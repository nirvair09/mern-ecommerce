# 🛒 MERN E-Commerce Platform

A full-stack, production-grade **MERN e-commerce application** with a complete **Admin Panel**, **User Shopping UI**, **Cloudinary media uploads**, **JWT authentication**, **Redux state management**, and **PayPal-powered checkout**.

This project mimics real-world e-commerce flows including product lifecycle, order processing, stock management, reviews, global search, and secure role-based routing.

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

* JWT stored in **HTTP-only cookies** for security
* Full role-based access:

  * **Admin** → Dashboard + product/order management
  * **User** → Shopping pages + checkout
* Protected routes using custom `<CheckAuth />` logic

---

## 🧠 Core Logic Highlights

### **1. Protected Routing**

Every page is controlled by `<CheckAuth />`, which decides:

* Not authenticated → redirect to Login
* Authenticated User → allowed only Shopping pages
* Authenticated Admin → allowed only Admin pages
* Unauthorized access → redirected to `/not-authorized`

This ensures **zero leakage** between User and Admin routes.

---

### **2. Real-Time Product State**

* Cart checks stock quantity
* “Out of Stock” logic updates instantly when stock hits 0
* Reviews unlocked only after successful purchase
* Admin product updates reflect instantly on the shopping interface

---

### **3. Payment Flow**

* PayPal SDK integrated
* Redirects to PayPal sandbox
* On successful payment:

  * Order is created
  * Stock decreases
  * Order status updated to "Confirmed"

---

### **4. Global Search System**

Searches across:

* title
* description
* brand
* category

Backend uses efficient MongoDB queries for fast results.
